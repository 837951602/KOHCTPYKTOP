# KOHCTPYKTOP
Remake of KOHCTPYKTOP, Zachtronics. WIP

## Done
* Drawing
* Copying&Cutting
* Save&Load (Only support vanilla save format. It's others' job to support vanilla in their remakes, not me to support theirs)
* Different size of board (vanilla format also save size but fail to read different sizes)

## Todo
* Specification
* Simulation
* Level format

# Why make another while there are already some remakes?

I don't like their operations. I put N-silicon, P-silicon, Metal, Via, Erase silicon and Erase Metal on (no|Ctrl|Shift) + (Left|Right) mouse, which feels at least better
